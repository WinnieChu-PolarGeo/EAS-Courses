def get_time(time, r_time):

    Because of the arbitrary waveform, we need to compute some times before and
    after the actually wanted times for interpolation of the waveform.

    Some implementation details: The actual times here don't really matter. We
    create a vector of time.size+2, so it is similar to the input times and
    accounts that it will require a bit earlier and a bit later times. Really
    important are only the minimum and maximum times. The Fourier DLF, with
    `pts_per_dec=-1`, computes times from minimum to at least the maximum,
    where the actual spacing is defined by the filter spacing. It subsequently
    interpolates to the wanted times. Afterwards, we interpolate those again to
    compute the actual waveform response.

    Note: We could first call `waveform`, and get the actually required times
          from there. This would make this function obsolete. It would also
          avoid the double interpolation, first in `empymod.model.time` for the
          Fourier DLF with `pts_per_dec=-1`, and second in `waveform`. Doable.
          Probably not or marginally faster. And the code would become much
          less readable.

    """Custom wrapper of empymod.model.bipole.

    Here, we compute WalkTEM data using the ``empymod.model.bipole`` routine as
    an example. We could achieve the same using ``empymod.model.dipole`` or
    ``empymod.model.loop``.

    We model the big source square loop by computing only half of one side of
    the electric square loop and approximating the finite length dipole with 3
    point dipole sources. The result is then multiplied by 8, to account for
    all eight half-sides of the square loop.

    The implementation here assumes a central loop configuration, where the
    receiver (1 m2 area) is at the origin, and the source is a tx_side x tx_side m electric
    loop, centered around the origin.


    Parameters
    ----------
    moment : str {'lm', 'hm'}
        Moment. If 'lm', above defined ``lm_off_time``, ``lm_waveform_times``,
        and ``lm_waveform_current`` are used. Else, the corresponding
        ``hm_``-parameters.

    res : ndarray
        Resistivities of the resistivity model (see ``empymod.model.bipole``
        for more info.)

    depth : ndarray
        Depths of the resistivity model (see ``empymod.model.bipole`` for more
        info.)

    off_times : ndarray
        Receive gate times.

    tx_waveform : dict {"i": ndarray, "t": ndarray}
        Dictionary describing the transmit waveform. Must have two items of equal length,
        "i", an array describing the current levels and "t", an array giving the time coordinates
        of the current changes described in i.

    tx_side : float
        Side length of the square transmit loop
